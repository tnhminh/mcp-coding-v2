# TEST_STRATEGY

Layers: unit, integration, MCP protocol contract, end-to-end, browser, deployment/rollback and adversarial security tests.

Every executable task must run targeted verification then full applicable checks. Current baseline command: `npm run check` = lint + strict typecheck + Vitest + production TypeScript build.

Next: in-memory MCP client contract tests for modern initialize/list/call; HTTP endpoint lifecycle tests; invalid request/schema tests.
