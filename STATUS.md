# STATUS

Updated: 2026-08-25

## Overall
`IN DEVELOPMENT` — not production ready.

## Verified complete
- Empty-repository discovery.
- Node 24.14.0, npm 11.9.0, Git 2.51.0 environment observed.
- MCP official v2 packages installed (`@modelcontextprotocol/server` 2.0.0, `@modelcontextprotocol/node` 2.0.0).
- Strict TypeScript foundation.
- `system_health` MCP tool.
- stdio bootstrap.
- localhost Streamable HTTP bootstrap with `/health/live` and `/health/ready`.
- MCP 2026-07-28 contract suite PASS over real stdio and HTTP clients, including tools/list, tools/call, unknown-tool and strict input validation.
- HTTP serving corrected to SDK v2 `createMcpHandler` per-request modern architecture.
- Typed configuration with loopback-only HTTP host validation, bounded port and log-level schema.
- Structured application error model with safe public projection.
- JSON logging with reserved-field isolation and sensitive-key redaction; generic internal error messages are not emitted raw.
- Graceful/idempotent HTTP runtime close verified.
- `npm run check`: lint + typecheck + 12 tests + build PASS.
- Project aggregate and async repository interface designed for SQLite/PostgreSQL interchangeability.
- SQLite persistence via `better-sqlite3` 13.0.3 with versioned transactional migration `001_projects`, foreign keys, busy timeout and WAL for file databases.
- Project persistence verifies complete aggregate round-trip, case-insensitive alias uniqueness, update/delete behavior and JSON-only metadata.

## Active
P2-T02 Canonical root/path resolver and cross-project isolation tests.

## Known gaps
All Phase 2+ subsystems and most Phase 1 production concerns remain unimplemented. No production auth, persistence, project registry, filesystem engine, command runner, brain, workflow, Git/browser/remote/deploy engine, observability stack or Control Center yet.
